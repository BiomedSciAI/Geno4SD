## Pull Requests

Know how to fix something? We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

- Check for open issues, or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug. Opening a separate issue to discuss the change is less important for smaller changes, as the discussion can be done in the pull request.
- Fork the relevant repository on GitHub, and start making your changes.
- Check out the README for the project for information specific to that repository.
- Push the change (we recommend using a separate branch for your feature). Pleae also consider to add test/coverage of your code.
- Open a pull request.

We try to merge and deploy changes as soon as possible, or at least leave some feedback.
