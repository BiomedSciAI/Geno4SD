CuNA
============

Complex diseases are characterized by their intricate etiology, combining a variety of factors and spanning a diverse set of omics data types. To obtain insights on disease subtypes, biomarkers associated with them,and predict disease states, we need to integrate and analyze multiomics data. Here, we propose a cumulant-based network analysis toolkit (*CuNA*) which finds higher-order interactions between multiomics variables and identify disease subtypes, discover biomarkers, visualize them in an interactive dashboard, and provide a novel method to compute cumulant-based risk scores (*CuRES*) from multiomics data.


Framework
----------
.. image:: img/CuNA_pipeline.png

Input 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CuNA takes a csv file as input with the features in columns and samples in rows (see `./docs/data/tcga_mixomics_new_train_forcuna.csv`). It is multithreaded and takes an argument for number of threads. 

Output 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
cd 
CuNA outputs three components: 

Networks 
----------
a) Network file with three columns, `v1`,`v2`,`count`, corresponding to two vertices and the interaction/edge term between them. 
b) A file with the communities corresponding to the features. 
c) A file with the node rank (importance of node)

CuRES
----------
A risk score called *CuRES* computed from multi-omics data.


CuNAviz
----------
An interactive visualizer, *CuNAviz* can be executed from
