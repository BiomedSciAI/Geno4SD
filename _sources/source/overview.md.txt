# Overview

Geno4SD is an open-source computational framework written in Python that facilitates analysis of omics data across biological scales, from single-cell analysis to large patient cohorts, and over multiple modalities, including genomics, transcriptomics, clinical medical data, and patient demographics. Within this toolkit are analytic methods that span phylogenetics, epidemilogy, topological data analysis, and ML/AL frameworks for omics scale data.

Geno4SD provides access to individual tools as well as detailed use cases for analyses that demonstrate how multiple methodologies can be leveraged together.
